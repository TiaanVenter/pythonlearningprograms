# pythonlearningprograms
A repo for basic/instructional programs I've created. Most of these ideas originate from online training material such as FCC and YT content creators.

Not much to understand here. Just a repo of training examples/exercises.

This contains some of my own playing around, but is mainly from the numerous tutorials of Moshfegh Hamedani, retyped/reworded.

# pythonprograms
A repo for basic/instructional programs I've created. Most of these ideas originate from online training material such as FCC and YT content creators.

Not much to understand here. Just a repo of training examples/exercises. Let me know if you know of any open junior devs positions internationally please :)

This could turn into a repo for cool scripts and wares I find written in py in the future.

All of this still feels hopelessly pointless! :) Have to find my own 'point'.
